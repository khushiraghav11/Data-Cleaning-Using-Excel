I took a dataset from Kaggle named 'Customer Personality Analysis' and cleaned it using Microsoft Excel.
I cleaned the dataset in the following ways:
  I identified missing values and replaced them with "N/A".
  I looked for duplicates but the dataset did not have any.
  I formatted the dataset to fix incorrect delimiters (It had 'tab' as its delimiter so I changed it to 'comma').
  I converted the date formats to a consistent type in the column which was storing dates.
  I fixed the case of the dataset to PROPER(first letter capital of each word).
  I sorted the dataset in 'Ascending Order' by the ID column.
  I checked and fixed data types.
